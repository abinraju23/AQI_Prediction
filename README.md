# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts **Air Quality Index (AQI)** levels using machine learning models, with a focus on **time series behaviour**, **feature engineering**, and **model comparison**. The work was developed as part of a data analytics coursework and showcases a full end‑to‑end workflow: from raw data to evaluated predictive models.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Poor air quality has significant impacts on public health and urban living. This project builds data‑driven models to **predict AQI / pollutant levels** from historical air quality and meteorological data.

Key highlights:

- Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering for temporal and environmental patterns
- Baseline and advanced machine learning models for prediction
- Model evaluation and interpretation with visualisations
- Fully reproducible Jupyter notebook

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyse historical air quality data and understand key drivers of AQI  
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models for AQI prediction  
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate error metrics  
- Provide insights that could support air quality monitoring and decision‑making
